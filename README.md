IF YOU ARE GONNA IMPROVE THE CODE 
ALWAYS DO IT IN THE TEMP BRANCH AND NOT THE MAIN BRANCH!!
AFTER REVIEWING THE CHANGES THEY WILL BE PUSHED TO THE MAIN BRANCH !!..
IF YOU HAVE A BETTER WAY OR A DIFFERENT WAY TO SOLVE THE QUESTIONS 
IT'S ALWAYS BETTER TO COMMIT YOUR FILE VIA PULL REQUESTS AND LABELING 'ENHANCEMENT' IN THE MAIN BRANCH.
THERE'S ALWAYS A ROOM FOR DISCUSSIONS UNDER THE DISCUSSION TAB .

“ Code is like humour. When you have to explain it, it’s bad.” – Cory House
